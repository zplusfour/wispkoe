      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p>
        Wispkoe has been, is, and always will be a place where you can freely
        speak your mind. However, to help keep this a safe yet still great
        community, we have to put some rules in place.
      </p>
      <h2>1. Takedowns</h2>
      <p>
        Takedowns of posts can only be done by the admin. If you wish to send a
        post takedown request, please email
        <a href="mailto:getdevved@gmail.com">getdevved@gmail.com</a>, give a
        screenshot of the post and give the reason for takedown request. It
        shall be looked into.
      </p>
      <h2>2. Misconducts</h2>
      <p>Here are the base rules for Wispkoe:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Using Wispkoe to promote illegal goods or behaviour is strictly
          prohibited, no matter the level of illegality.
        </li>
        <li>Trying to promote sexual content in any case is prohibited.</li>
        <li>
          Spam posting (repeatedly posting in large amounts) is prohibited.
        </li>
        <li>
          Intentionally trying to XSS the site or place viruses is not allowed
          in any case.
        </li>
        <li>Blackmail, extortion, anything like that is not allowed.</li>
        <li>Impersonating admin (or anyone) is not allowed.</li>
        <p>
          These are subject to change with or without notification. Failure to
          follow them will result in post takedowns. If rules are broken
          repeatedly, you may be banned.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <h2>3. Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Wispkoe does not collect any personal/sensitive info (name, age, date,
        birth, etc.) and any data you post on this site is not our problem and
        does not count as data collection.
